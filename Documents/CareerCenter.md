## Career Center

* What I learned in the Career Center presentation:

  Before I was in the presentation, I had thought that my own skills, abilities and experiences are the most important things for my career.
  However, after this presentation, I learned that Networking is also very important. Then, I learned what Networking means and how I can do Networking well.

* One thing I am going to work on regarding my career development:

  First of all, I am a kind of introvert. And I think that it would be not good for Networking.
  However, it can be so difficult to change my personality because it has been shaped throughout my whole life.
  So I will practice how to communicate naturally with people and make me look confident and competent.
